                <p>I'm 20, and in second year at the University of Waterloo. Although I nominally study Software
                    Engineering, I would much rather find jobs where I get paid to reflect on technological advances.
                    Regular opportunities to tell overconfident people that they're wrong are also welcome. I'm taking
                    the ENGL 210E course this term to do just that. In my spare time I code, build rockets with <a
                        href="https://www.waterloorocketry.com/">Waterloo Rocketry</a>, and experiment with amateur
                    radio.</p>
                <p>Some accomplishments I'm proud of:</p>
