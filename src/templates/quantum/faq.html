                        <p class="card-text">Most computers only have 2 states at the most basic level; 1 and 0, on and
                            off, yes and no. Those states can be interpreted in many ways, but each individual part is
                            one or the other. This two-state representation is called binary. Quantum computers promise
                            to change that by allowing each component to represent an infinite number of states.
                            Although still in development, experts can already predict that they will help us secure
                            data as well as present challenges to existing cryptography methods. Additionally, they have
                            the potential to improve scientific simulations from the weather to drug research. This is
                            because the universe is essentially a quantum (and not a binary) system, so quantum
                            computers are more suitable for simulating it.

                        <p class="card-text">Many technological innovations are initially dismissed as impossible or
                            useless. Other innovations are hotly anticipated for the near future but gradually fizzle
                            out. Quantum computing is not either of those. There have been many breathless predictions
                            made, although some are more credible than others. The general scientific consensus seems to
                            be that quantum computing will be very useful in the future, but the experts disagree on
                            when exactly "the future" is. Quantum computers can already do certain computations that
                            their non-quantum counterparts cannot, but have yet to actually do anything groundbreaking.
                            However, other quantum technologies explored during the development of quantum computing
                            development have been very useful. For more information, see the later answer on quantum key
                            exchange.

                        <p class="card-text">This is an understandable question as both have been heavily featured in
                            the media. Unfortunately, quantum computing and AI are mostly unrelated besides the fact
                            that both are from the technology industry. This is to say that they may indirectly help
                            each other by increasing public attention to technology, but they have no other
                            relationship. On the flip side, this means that bright scientists interested in technology
                            generally have to pick between one anda the otherâ€”so the industries compete for talent as
                            well. An interesting anecdote is that Scott Aaronson (a quantum researcher) says that in AI
                            practice is ahead of research but in quantum research is significantly ahead of practice.

                        <p class="card-text">These three are really all variants of the same question. Encryption
                            protects data. Both people and businesses use encryption. All cryptocurrencies use
                            encryption in one form or another. Bitcoin is one such cryptocurrency. As previously
                            mentioned, quantum computers have the potential to break existing encryption algorithms. In
                            many cases this is because the algorithms rely on the fact that if you take two large prime
                            numbers p, q and multiply them to get n = pq, it is very hard to get p and q back from n
                            even if you have a supercomputer. This process is called factoring. Quantum computers can
                            use a process called Shor's algorithm to quickly do this. Although existing quantum
                            computers (as of 2025) are not yet powerful enough to do this, many experts have raised
                            concerns that future models could. This presents risks to anyone using encryption, which
                            includes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This question is very hard to answer. For one, we only know the public
                            state of
                            quantum computing development. Countries or companies could have secret quantum computers
                            more
                            powerful than ones we know of. Additionally, some computer scientists have proposed that
                            today's
                            quantum computers are already very close to breaking encryption if we combine them with
                            classical (non-quantum) computers. Finally, many nations and cybercrime groups are already
                            collecting encrypted data so they can store it for years and later decrypt it with quantum
                            computing. The good news is that most experts agree that quantum computers should not be
                            able to
                            break encryption today or within the next 2-3 years.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Broadly speaking, governments around the world are searching for encryption
                            algorithms that do not rely on prime numbers, and will thus withstand attacks by quantum
                            computers (as far as we know...). On one level, this means funding research grants so
                            scientists are paid to research and develop those algorithms. Once algorithms are developed,
                            government agencies (NIST of the United States for Western countries, GOST of Russia for
                            Russia and central Asian countries) hold competitions. Scientists submit their algorithms,
                            NIST invites other scientists to attack them, and a council of experts eventually decide on
                            which algorithms to recommend. This process is called "standardisation" and every popular
                            encryption algorithm has gone through it. NIST first began this process in 2016 and has
                            already published some standards for quantum-safe encryption in 2023 and 2024.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">For one, you may wish to join the quantum industry if you are young or
                            looking for a change in career. Apart from that, most people are not equipped to research
                            ways to defend computers against quantum computing. Nevertheless, you can write to your
                            political representatives to explain the importance of quantum computing funding.
                            Additionally, if you work for a company in e-commerce, healthcare, and banking that must
                            keep data secure for long periods of time, you should be looking into quantum-safe

                        <p class="card-text">Previously, I mentioned that quantum technologies can help us be more
                            secure. I'll skip explaining the physics, but the key point is that two people communicating
                            could use a protocol known as "quantum key exchange" to both agree on a secret key to secure
                            their messages withâ€”even if a third person was listening in the whole time! After the secret
                            key is established, no further eavesdropping is possible. This security is guaranteed by
                            physics as we know it. While most people can't go out to buy lasers and satellites to use
                            this, this technology has been heavily tested in the real world (including at UWaterloo) and
                            banks and militaries have already started using it.</p>
